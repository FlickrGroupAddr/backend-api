# Decisions

**RFC 2119 keywords. MUST and MUST NOT are absolute. SHOULD is a strong default a good argument may
overrule. MAY is optional.**

**The code is the specification. This file holds only what the code cannot say: why.**

Labels are `ADR-nn`, never `D-n` — Cloudflare's database is called D1 and the collision confuses
everyone but its author. Numbers are cited from code comments, so they **MUST NOT** be renumbered.

## ADR-08 — Fail-polite. This one outranks the rest.

**Where an outcome could mean a human declined, FGA MUST treat it as terminal.** Even when the same
outcome could also mean something retryable. **When this conflicts with any other decision here,
this one wins.**

A moderated group does not reject an add. It puts the photo in a queue for an unpaid volunteer. If
that person declines, the API says nothing — the photo simply never appears.

**So a second add is not a retry. It is a fresh submission, and the moderator sees it again.**

The asymmetry decides it. Wrongly terminal costs one request, visible to the user who chose to use
FGA. Wrongly retried spends a stranger's attention, invisibly, every night.

**The user MUST be told, in plain language, when a request stopped for this reason.** A silent stop
reads as a bug, and a user who thinks FGA is broken adds the photo by hand — which recreates the
exact harm.

Lives in `src/adds/classify.ts`.

## ADR-07 — Classify by Flickr's error code. Unknown means terminal.

**Only codes 5, 105 and 106 MAY be retried. Everything else is terminal, including codes Flickr has
not invented yet.**

**The default is inverted from the 2022 version, and that is the point.** That version retried every
unrecognized code nightly, forever — a bucket holding codes 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 10 and 11, every one a
permanent condition. **An unknown failure is the one most likely to be permanent.**

**Widening the retryable set is the most dangerous edit available in this repository.**

The table lives in `src/adds/classify.ts`. Read it there.

## ADR-10 — FIFO per (user, group). The queue is never jumped.

**Every request MUST be attempted in append order within its `(user, group)` queue.**

**The API Worker MAY attempt a new request immediately only when it is the sole unresolved request
in its queue.** A queue of length one is the only case where an immediate attempt cannot take an
allowance slot from something that waited longer.

**The nightly sweep MUST stop a queue at its first retryable failure.** Everything behind the head is
blocked by the same daily cap, so trying the next one is the queue-jump this rule forbids, wearing an
efficiency costume.

**Order MUST come from `requests.id`, never a timestamp.** Timestamps tie.

Queues keyed by different tuples are fully independent, so the sweep MAY run them in any order.

Lives in `src/sweep.ts` and `src/db/requests.ts`.

## ADR-11 — A pair that reached a moderator is remembered forever

**Codes 6 and 7 MUST write a permanent `moderated_pairs` row**, and it MUST outlive the request.

**On resubmission the interface MUST warn, and MUST NOT block.** The warning informs. The person
decides. A block would override a human's judgment about their own photo, which is ADR-08 pointed the
wrong way.

**Check the pool first.** A photo now in the pool was approved, so the warning MUST NOT fire — a
false alarm spends the credibility the real warning needs.

The table is named for what is known. **No rejection signal exists in the Flickr API**, so nothing
here may imply one.

## ADR-01 — The Flickr account is the identity

**FGA MUST NOT store an email address, a display name, or any contact detail.** The NSID is the key.

**Understand the consequence rather than assuming it away.** Flickr offers no scope narrower than
`write`, so the token FGA holds grants edit access to the user's entire account, while the product
needs only "add this photo to that group". **FGA holds a credential far more powerful than its
feature set.**

## ADR-02 — OAuth state lives in a Durable Object

**The request-token secret MUST be held in a Durable Object keyed by `oauth_token`.** It **MUST NOT**
go in Workers KV, which offers no read-after-write guarantee across points of presence.

**D1 would also have worked** — its reads are strongly consistent. **Lifecycle decides it, not
consistency.** A D1 table here would be a table whose every row is destined for deletion, plus a
sweep the cron must not forget. The Durable Object needs no table and cleans itself.

**It MUST set an alarm on creation that deletes its storage after roughly 15 minutes.** Most logins
are abandoned, so that path is the common case.

**One object per login ATTEMPT, not per user.** At that point no user exists yet.

Lives in `src/oauth/login-attempt.ts`.

## ADR-03 — Tokens are AES-GCM encrypted in D1, under a separate key

**Each user's Flickr token MUST be encrypted before it reaches D1.** The key is a Worker secret.

**The token key and the session key MUST be different values.** Rotating the session key logs
everyone out and costs nothing. Rotating the token key means re-encrypting every stored token.
**Sharing one key makes the cheap rotation as expensive as the dear one, so neither ever happens.**

Per-user tokens **MUST NOT** go in Cloudflare Secrets Store — it caps at 100 secrets per account,
which is a ceiling you discover only once the product works.

Lives in `src/crypto/tokens.ts`.

## ADR-06 and ADR-12 — The session is a signed cookie, host-only

**The cookie is `__Host-fga_session`: `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Path=/`, no `Domain`.**
It carries the NSID. The Flickr token **MUST NOT** reach the browser.

**The `__Host-` prefix is browser-enforced.** Without it, anything able to set cookies on the parent
domain can plant a same-named cookie that shadows ours, and the API cannot tell them apart.

**Every API response MUST carry `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` set to our own configured origin.**

**The Worker MUST NOT reflect the request's `Origin` header.** With credentials enabled that lets any
site on the internet make authenticated calls as a logged-in user. **It is a two-line mistake and it
looks exactly like the fix.**

`src/session.ts` is the only place that knows the cookie's name or attributes. Set, read and clear
all go through it.

## ADR-04 — The work engine is a nightly cron over D1

**Pending requests MUST be rows in D1.** A Cron Trigger is the engine. Per-user Durable Object alarms
**MUST NOT** be introduced without measuring one of: the scan threatens Worker limits, Flickr
rate-limits the burst, or per-user scheduling becomes a product requirement.

A `SELECT` beats a fan-out when you need to ask what is stuck and why. **Plan cost was never the
argument and does not reopen it.**

Lives in `src/sweep.ts`.

## ADR-05 — Adds are idempotent per (photo, group)

**The handler MUST confirm the pair has not already succeeded before calling Flickr.**

`flickr.photos.getAllContexts` beats the local check because it also sees adds FGA did not make.
**"Already in the pool" MUST be treated as success.**

## ADR-09 — No cache in front of D1

**FGA MUST NOT build an application cache.** Every `/v001/*` response carries
`Cache-Control: private, no-store`.

**Cost is not the reason to cache.** D1 bills reads at $0.001 per million rows. **Writes cost 1,000×
reads**, so anyone adding a per-attempt write MUST check the volume first.

The trap this prevents: a per-user response in a shared cache without a per-user key, which serves
one member's queue to another.

**Anyone auditing indexes MUST use `PRAGMA index_list`.** A `UNIQUE` constraint creates an index that
`grep "CREATE INDEX"` will never find, and the usual result is a duplicate B-tree that costs writes
and serves nothing. **Read a query plan only against populated tables** — on an empty one SQLite has
no statistics and guesses.

## ADR-13 — TypeScript, on the current stable toolchain

**The project MUST track current stable and MUST NOT adopt a `beta`, `rc`, `next` or `dev` tag.**

Rust was rejected on maintenance — `workers-rs` had 9 commits in 13 weeks against the runtime's
1,360. Python was rejected because it is in open beta.

**TypeScript 7 costs the project `typescript-eslint`, which cannot consume the Go-native compiler
until 7.1.** Biome parses TypeScript itself and is unaffected.

**ESLint was never in this project.** Biome went in at the scaffold commit. This was a choice, not a
migration.

**Revisit when TypeScript 7.1 ships stable — and returning is NOT automatic.** Reopening needs a named
lint rule this project needs, requiring full type information, that Biome does not implement.

## ADR-14 — Integrate when feasible, innovate otherwise

**Where a maintained dependency runs in this runtime and does the job, take it.** Hand-written code
**MUST** be justified against four tests: does it run here, **is the platform already doing it**, is
it maintained, is the spec short with published vectors.

**The second test pays off most often.** `crypto.subtle.timingSafeEqual` and `crypto.randomUUID()`
were both about to be replaced by dependencies.

**The OAuth 1.0a signer is the documented exception.** Every package on npm is unmaintained,
Node-only, or wraps an HTTP client this project does not use. It is tested against RFC 5849's own
vectors, because a signature Flickr rejects tells you nothing about which layer was wrong.

Lives in `src/oauth/signature.ts`.

## ADR-15 — Which store holds what

**New state goes in D1 if either answer is yes.** Does anything need to find this without already
knowing its key? Does it outlive a single interaction?

**A Worker cannot enumerate the Durable Objects in a namespace.** Anything that must be swept,
listed or reported on therefore **MUST NOT** live in one.

The OAuth attempt is the only state answering no to both. **Workers KV holds nothing.**

## ADR-16 — A request has two identifiers

**`requests.id` orders and never leaves the server. `requests.public_id` is a UUIDv4 handle that
always does.**

**The ordering key MUST NOT become a UUID.** Every UUID form ties somewhere, and v7 ties within a
millisecond — which is exactly what bulk-queueing fifty photos looks like.

**v4 rather than v7 for the public handle**, because v7 republishes its own creation time.

## ADR-17 — Every list endpoint is paginated, with a cursor

**A list endpoint MUST NOT return an unbounded result set.** Pagination **MUST** be keyset, never
offset.

**Offset paging silently skips rows here.** The nightly sweep resolves requests continuously, so the
set shifts under the reader between pages.

**The cursor MUST be opaque, and the end of a list is a fact the server states.** A short page is not
the end — that is wrong exactly when the last page is full.

**A `limit` MUST be capped, not merely defaulted.** FGA's is 1–200, default 50.

## Considered and rejected

| Option | Why not |
|---|---|
| AWS | Every piece has a simpler Cloudflare equivalent here |
| An off-the-shelf OAuth 1.0a library | All unmaintained, Node-only, or wrapping an HTTP client we do not use |
| Per-user Durable Object alarms | **Deferred, not rejected.** See ADR-04's promotion criteria |
| D1 read replication | Removed 2026-08-13. One user, in ENAM, with the database in ENAM. Replicas are eventually consistent and the bookmark plumbing fails silently |
| Cloudflare Secrets Store | Right product, wrong maturity, and a 100-secret ceiling |
| Workers KV | Consistency model is wrong for the login path |
| Cognito or Google login | Both supply an identity ADR-01 declines to hold |

## Still open

- **An unanswered add is terminal, and that MAY be too strict.** A dropped connection has no error
  code, and the pool may be moderated. `flickr.groups.getInfo` reports whether a pool is moderated,
  and **for an unmoderated pool the ambiguity disappears** — `getAllContexts` then answers
  definitively. Only moderated pools would stay terminal.
- **The sweep SHOULD skip a group whose `throttle.mode` is `disabled`.** It costs one wasted call per
  disabled pool. Not urgent: a live add into one returns code 11, which ADR-07 already resolves.
- **The wording a user sees when FGA has deliberately stopped.** That the queue is shown is settled.
  The sentence itself is not, and it either delivers ADR-08's promise or quietly undercuts it.
